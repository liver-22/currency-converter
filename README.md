There is a simple currency calculator, which can transform PLN (Polish Zloty) into 3 different currencies:

- Euro
- United States dollar
- Great Britain pound

On the page, you need to select one of the available currencies, enter the PLN value and click the button below. The result will show the converted value in the selected currency.

### Code

There were used 3 languages to write the page:

- HTML - markup language,
- CSS - style sheet language,
- JavaScript - programming language.

### Responsiveness

My webpage is created to automatically resize and looks good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).

### Style BEM

I have used Block Element Modifier methodology in my code, that helps you to achieve reusable components, making it easy to find any elements in the code.
